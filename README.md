# point_proj_sls_calib
This repo is to give "a flexible calibration for Structured-light systems consisting of a dot projector and a camera". The segmentation of the imaged structured-light pattern is not included. Dot extraction (based on color thresholding or other technique..) from calibration images should be performed before using this code.

This code corresponding to the research work published in:
